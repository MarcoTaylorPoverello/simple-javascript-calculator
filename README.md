# simple-javascript-calculator

- I created a very simple, 3 file calculator as a good introduction and possibly even a small challange to those just starting with their javascript journey.  

- The entire project comprises of 3 files, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

- Within the script.js file, there are commented notes that help guide you through the process of creating a working calculator.
