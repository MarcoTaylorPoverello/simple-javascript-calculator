# simple-javascript-calculator

- I created a very simple 3 file coded calculator, as a good introduction and possibly even a small challange to those just starting with their javascript journey.  

- The entire project comprises of 3 files, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Running the project

- Because this is a very small project. There is no live or demo server.
  
- If you use VSCode you can download an extension called `Live Server`, which once installed, will give you a small `Go Live` icon on the bottom right of your code editor. Just click it when you want to run the code and see if it is working and it will give you a small live server while your code editor is running.
